== DESCRIPTION:

This gem adds create_or_update functionality to ActiveRecord based on a user-defined natural-key.

== SYNOPSIS:

Define natural key for your model as follows:

  #
  # Table users(first_name varchar, last_name varchar, age integer, address string, salary integer)
  #
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    natural_key :first_name, :last_name
  end

With this in place, a method 'create_or_update_by_natural_key' can be used to invoke create/update.

  User.create_or_update_by_natural_key(:first_name => 'John', :last_name => "Smith", :age => 25, :address => "New York")

== INSTALL:

  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
  gem install natural_key
